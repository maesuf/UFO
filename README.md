## Summary
### The one drawback of the webpage is that you cannot refresh your search unless you refresh the actual page. You also donâ€™t have the ability to go back to previous searches on the web browser. Furthermore, the data set only includes sightings from 2010 and sightings in the US which limits our search parameters.
